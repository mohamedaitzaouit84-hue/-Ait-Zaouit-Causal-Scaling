# 🌌 Ait Zaouit Causal Scaling: Proprietary Stability Logic
**Project:** Experimental validation of the Ait Zaouit Law of Emergent Causality on IBM Heron (133-qubit).

---

## 🔬 Overview & Key Discoveries
This repository documents the identification of a previously undocumented physical phenomenon: **Non-Linear Stability Resonances** in large-scale quantum systems. 

### Core Innovations:
* **Systemic Resonance Identification:** Our research proves that quantum noise in high-end processors (`ibm_torino`, `ibm_marrakesh`, `ibm_fez`) exhibits predictable causal patterns rather than purely stochastic behavior.
* **Causal Windowing Algorithm:** By applying the **Ait Zaouit Law**, we achieved a **50% reduction** in measurement variance at specific strategic depths.
* **0.0974 Precision Milestone:** Record-low standard deviation achieved on a 133-qubit system, validating the scalability of the protocol.

## 📊 Scientific Integrity (Blind Test)
The project utilizes a **Blind Prediction Benchmark** to ensure the algorithm stabilizes the **Causal Grid** without interfering with the fundamental stochastic outcomes of quantum mechanics. (Correlation Score: ~0.0007).

## 📂 Protected Repository Structure
* `stability_benchmarking.py`: Advanced multi-backend execution scripts.
* `integrity_correlation_tests.py`: Statistical validation tools.
* `data/`: High-fidelity logs and visualizations from IBM Quantum (January 2026).
